However, contemporary causal inference methods, premised on counterfactual or potential outcomes approaches, often include processing steps before the final estimation step. The purposes of this paper are: (i) to overview the recent emergence of prediction underpinning steps in contemporary causal inference methods as a useful perspective on contemporary causal inference methods, and (ii) explore the role of machine learning (as one approach to `best prediction') in causal inference. Causal inference methods covered include propensity scores, inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs), G computation and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Machine learning has been used more for propensity scores and TMLE, and there is potential for increased use in G computation and estimation of IPTWs.},

  abstract = {The consistency of doubly robust estimators relies on the consistent estimation of at least one of two nuisance regression parameters. In moderate-to-large dimensions, the use of flexible data-adaptive regression estimators may aid in achieving this consistency. However, n1/2-consistency of doubly robust estimators is not guaranteed if one of the nuisance estimators is inconsistent. In this paper, we present a doubly robust estimator for survival analysis with the novel property that it converges to a Gaussian variable at an n1/2-rate for a large class of data-adaptive estimators of the nuisance parameters, under the only assumption that at least one of them is consistently estimated at an n1/4-rate. This result is achieved through the adaptation of recent ideas in semiparametric inference, which amount to (i) Gaussianizing (ie, making asymptotically linear) a drift term that arises in the asymptotic analysis of the doubly robust estimator and (ii) using cross-fitting to avoid entropy conditions on the nuisance estimators. We present the formula of the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which allows for the computation of doubly robust confidence intervals and p values. We illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimator in simulation studies and demonstrate its use in a phase III clinical trial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)\textendash positive breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Most causal inference methods consider counterfactual variables under interventions that set the exposure to a fixed value. With continuous or multi-valued treatments or exposures, such counterfactuals may be of little practical interest because no feasible intervention can be implemented that would bring them about. Longitudinal modified treatment policies (LMTPs) are a recently developed nonparametric alternative that yield effects of immediate practical relevance with an interpretation in terms of meaningful interventions such as reducing or increasing the exposure by a given amount. LMTPs also have the advantage that they can be designed to satisfy the positivity assumption required for causal inference. We present a novel sequential regression formula that identifies the LMTP causal effect, study properties of the LMTP statistical estimand such as the efficient influence function and the efficiency bound, and propose four different estimators. Two of our estimators are efficient, and one is sequentially doubly robust in the sense that it is consistent if, for each time point, either an outcome regression or a treatment mechanism is consistently estimated. We perform numerical studies of the estimators, and present the results of our motivating study on hypoxemia and mortality in intubated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Software implementing our methods is provided in the form of the open source R package lmtp freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/nt-williams/lmtp) and CRAN.},

By focusing on estimating a specific target of interest (e.g., the average effect of a treatment), rather than on estimating the full underlying data generating distribution, IF-based estimators are often able to achieve asymptotically optimal mean-squared error. Still, many researchers find IF-based estimators to be opaque or overly technical, which makes their use less prevalent and their benefits less available. To help foster understanding and trust in IF-based estimators, we present tangible, visual illustrations of when and how IF-based estimators can outperform standard ``plug-in'' estimators.

Ascertaining which interventions will be most effective and when they should be implemented is challenging because social conditions vary across the life course and are subject to time-varying confounding. Marginal structural models (MSMs) may be useful but can present unique challenges when studying social epidemiologic exposures over the life course. We describe selected MSMs corresponding to common theoretical life-course models and identify key issues for consideration related to time-varying confounding and late study enrollment. Using simulated data mimicking a cohort study evaluating the effects of depression in early, mid-, and late life on late-life stroke risk, we examined whether and when specific study characteristics and analytical strategies may induce bias. In the context of time-varying confounding, inverse-probability-weighted estimation of correctly specified MSMs accurately estimated the target causal effects, while conventional regression models showed significant bias. When no measure of early-life depression was available, neither MSMs nor conventional models were unbiased, due to confounding by early-life depression. To inform interventions, researchers need to identify timing of effects and consider whether missing data regarding exposures earlier in life may lead to biased estimates.},

While many choices are possible, causal effects are typically defined in terms of variation of the mean of counterfactual outcomes in hypothetical worlds in which specific treatment strategies are `applied' to all individuals. For example, one might compare two worlds: one where each individual receives some specific dose and a second where each individual receives some other dose. For our motivating study, defining causal effects in this way corresponds to (hypothetical) interventions that could not conceivably be implemented in the real world. In this work, we consider an alternative, complimentary framework that investigates variation in the mean of counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical treatment strategies where each individual receives a treatment dose corresponding to that actually received but modified in some pre-specified way. Quantification of this variation is defined in terms of contrasts for specific interventions as well as in terms of the parameters of a new class of marginal structural mean models. Within this framework, we propose three estimators: an outcome regression estimator, an inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator and a doubly robust estimator. We illustrate the methods with an analysis of the motivating data. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Continuous treatments have posed a significant challenge for causal inference, both in the formulation and identification of scientifically meaningful effects and in their robust estimation. Traditionally, focus has been placed on techniques applicable to binary or categorical treatments with few levels, allowing for the application of propensity score-based methodology with relative ease. Efforts to accommodate continuous treatments introduced the generalized propensity score, yet estimators of this nuisance parameter commonly utilize parametric regression strategies that sharply limit the robustness and efficiency of inverse probability weighted estimators of causal effect parameters. We formulate and investigate a novel, flexible estimator of the generalized propensity score based on a nonparametric function estimator that provably converges at a suitably fast rate to the target functional so as to facilitate statistical inference. With this estimator, we demonstrate the construction of nonparametric inverse probability weighted estimators of a class of causal effect estimands tailored to continuous treatments. To ensure the asymptotic efficiency of our proposed estimators, we outline several non-restrictive selection procedures for utilizing a sieve estimation framework to undersmooth estimators of the generalized propensity score. We provide the first characterization of such inverse probability weighted estimators achieving the nonparametric efficiency bound in a setting with continuous treatments, demonstrating this in numerical experiments. We further evaluate the higher-order efficiency of our proposed estimators by deriving and numerically examining the second-order remainder of the corresponding efficient influence function in the nonparametric model. Open source software implementing our proposed estimation techniques, the haldensify R package, is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long struggled to identify causal effects in nonexperimental settings. Many recently proposed strategies assume ignorability of the treatment assignment mechanism and require fitting two models\textemdash one for the assignment mechanism and one for the response surface. This article proposes a strategy that instead focuses on very flexibly modeling just the response surface using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling procedure, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART has several advantages: it is far simpler to use than many recent competitors, requires less guesswork in model fitting, handles a large number of predictors, yields coherent uncertainty intervals, and fluidly handles continuous treatment variables and missing data for the outcome variable. BART also naturally identifies heterogeneous treatment effects. BART produces more accurate estimates of average treatment effects compared to propensity score matching, propensity-weighted estimators, and regression adjustment in the nonlinear simulation situations examined. Further, it is highly competitive in linear settings with the ``correct'' model, linear regression. Supplemental materials including code and data to replicate simulations and examples from the article as well as methods for population inference are available online.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of treatment effects and more general estimands is typically achieved via parametric modeling, which is unsatisfactory since model misspecification is likely. Data-adaptive model building (e.g., statistical/machine learning) is commonly employed to reduce the risk of misspecification. Na\"ive use of such methods, however, delivers estimators whose bias may shrink too slowly with sample size for inferential methods to perform well, including those based on the bootstrap. Bias arises because standard data-adaptive methods are tuned toward minimal prediction error as opposed to, for example, minimal MSE in the estimator. This may cause excess variability that is difficult to acknowledge, due to the complexity of such strategies. Building on results from nonparametric statistics, targeted learning and debiased machine learning overcome these problems by constructing estimators using the estimand's efficient influence function under the nonparametric model. These increasingly popular methodologies typically assume that the efficient influence function is given, or that the reader is familiar with its derivation. In this article, we focus on derivation of the efficient influence function and explain how it may be used to construct statistical/machine-learning-based estimators. We discuss the requisite conditions for these estimators to perform well and use diverse examples to convey the broad applicability of the theory.},

LMTPs generalize many commonly used parameters for causal inference including average treatment effects, and facilitate the mathematical formalization, identification, and estimation of many novel parameters. LMTPs apply to a wide variety of exposures, including binary, multivariate, and continuous, as well as interventions that result in violations of the positivity assumption. LMTPs can accommodate time-varying treatments and confounders, competing risks, loss-to-follow-up, as well as survival, binary, or continuous outcomes. This tutorial aims to illustrate several practical uses of the LMTP framework, including describing different estimation strategies and their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. We provide numerous examples of types of research questions which can be answered within the proposed framework. We go into more depth with one of these examples -- specifically, estimating the effect of delaying intubation on critically ill COVID-19 patients' mortality.

  abstract = {``Heterogeneous treatment effects'' is a term which refers to conditional average treatment effects (i.e., CATEs) that vary across population subgroups. Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating such effects because they can help detect populations that may particularly benefit from or be harmed by a treatment. However, standard regression approaches for estimating heterogeneous effects are limited by preexisting hypotheses, test a single effect modifier at a time, and are subject to the multiple-comparisons problem. In this article, we aim to offer a practical guide to honest causal forests, an ensemble tree-based learning method which can discover as well as estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a data-driven approach. We discuss the fundamentals of tree-based methods, describe how honest causal forests can identify and estimate heterogeneous effects, and demonstrate an implementation of this method using simulated data. Our implementation highlights the steps required to simulate data sets, build honest causal forests, and assess model performance across a variety of simulation scenarios. Overall, this paper is intended for epidemiologists and other population health researchers who lack an extensive background in machine learning yet are interested in utilizing an emerging method for identifying and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.},

  abstract = {Most reported treatment effects in medical research studies are ambiguously defined, which can lead to misinterpretation of study results. This is because most authors do not attempt to describe what the treatment effect represents, and instead require readers to deduce this based on the reported statistical methods. However, this approach is challenging, because many methods provide counterintuitive results. For example, some methods include data from all patients, yet the resulting treatment effect applies only to a subset of patients, whereas other methods will exclude certain patients while results will apply to everyone. Additionally, some analyses provide estimates pertaining to hypothetical settings in which patients never die or discontinue treatment. Herein we introduce estimands as a solution to the aforementioned problem. An estimand is a clear description of what the treatment effect represents, thus saving readers the necessity of trying to infer this from study methods and potentially getting it wrong. We provide examples of how estimands can remove ambiguity from reported treatment effects and describe their current use in practice. The crux of our argument is that readers should not have to infer what investigators are estimating; they should be told explicitly.},

  abstract = {Most work in causal inference considers deterministic interventions that set each unit's treatment to some fixed value. However, under positivity violations these interventions can lead to nonidentification, inefficiency, and effects with little practical relevance. Further, corresponding effects in longitudinal studies are highly sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, resulting in widespread use of unrealistic parametric models. We propose a novel solution to these problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values rather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have several crucial advantages. First, they avoid positivity assumptions entirely. Second, they require no parametric assumptions and yet still admit a simple characterization of longitudinal effects, independent of the number of timepoints. For example, they allow longitudinal effects to be visualized with a single curve instead of lists of coefficients. After characterizing incremental interventions and giving identifying conditions for corresponding effects, we also develop general efficiency theory, propose efficient nonparametric estimators that can attain fast convergence rates even when incorporating flexible machine learning, and propose a bootstrap-based confidence band and simultaneous test of no treatment effect. Finally, we explore finite-sample performance via simulation, and apply the methods to study time-varying sociological effects of incarceration on entry into marriage.

We define a new causal parameter that takes into account the fact that intervention policies can result in stochastically assigned exposures. The statistical parameter that identifies the causal parameter of interest is established. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), augmented IPTW (A-IPTW), and targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLE) are developed. A simulation study is performed to demonstrate the properties of these estimators, which include the double robustness of the A-IPTW and the TMLE. An application example using physical activity data is presented.},

  abstract = {Methods for causal inference have experienced tremendous recent growth; this paper introduces key concepts underlying causal effect methods in epidemiologic research. ``Causal effects'' can be described using counterfactuals, which consider alternate versions of reality, and have a long history of use for interpreting cause-effect relationships in terms of what would have happened had things (e.g., exposures) been one way vs. another. Despite their intuitive appeal for thinking about causality, use of counterfactuals in formal causal inference requires attention to potential limitations. For example, consider a study of the effect of smoking on the 5-year cumulative risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of ambiguity in the ``effect of smoking,'' the corresponding counterfactual contrast is unclear and could correspond to a comparison between risk that would have happened if all study participants had ever smoked vs. never smoked, smoked 3 vs. 2 cigarettes per day, continued to smoke vs. quitting, and so on (1). There is an important degree of ambiguity in the language we use informally to ask causal questions. Causal inference is largely devoted to clarifying this ambiguity through use of potential outcomes as a formal framework, and a set of assumptions to allow interpretation of associations causally.},

Consider an observational study of the association between a continuous exposure and an outcome, where the exposure variable of primary interest suffers from classical measurement error (i.e., the measured exposures are distributed around the true exposure with independent error). In the absence of exposure measurement error, it is widely recognized that one should control for confounders of the association of interest to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of that exposure on the outcome of interest. However, here we show that, in the presence of classical exposure measurement error, the net bias in an estimate of the association of interest may increase upon adjustment for confounders. We offer an analytical expression for calculating the change in net bias in an estimate of the association of interest upon adjustment for a confounder in the presence of classical exposure measurement error, and we illustrate this problem using simulations.},

Here, we discuss the difficulty in meeting the positivity condition. Our motivating example is the per-protocol analysis of the Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) Trial. We estimated the average causal effect comparing the incidence of pregnancy by 26 weeks that would have occurred if all women had been assigned to aspirin and complied versus the incidence if all women had been assigned to placebo and complied. Using flexible targeted minimum loss-based estimation, we estimated a risk difference of 1.27\% (95\% CI: -9.83, 12.38). Using a less flexible inverse probability weighting approach, the risk difference was 5.77\% (95\% CI: -1.13, 13.05). However, the cumulative probability of compliance conditional on covariates approached 0 as follow-up accrued, indicating a practical violation of the positivity assumption, which limited our ability to make causal interpretations. The effects of nonpositivity were more apparent when using a more flexible estimator, as indicated by the greater imprecision. When faced with nonpositivity, one can use a flexible approach and be transparent about the uncertainty, use a parametric approach and smooth over gaps in the data, or target a different estimand that will be less vulnerable to positivity violations.},

Moreover, none of these concerns are unique to or inherent in the structure of a cross-sectional study. Regardless of when exposure and disease were ascertained relative to one another, a cross-sectional study may provide insights into the causal effects of exposure on disease incidence.

We focus on a class of parameters that have influence function which depends on two infinite dimensional nuisance functions and such that the bias of the one-step estimator of the parameter of interest is the expectation of the product of the estimation errors of the two nuisance functions. Our class includes many important treatment effect contrasts of interest in causal inference and econometrics, such as ATE, ATT, an integrated causal contrast with a continuous treatment, and the mean of an outcome missing not at random. We propose estimators of the target parameter that entertain approximately sparse regression models for the nuisance functions allowing for the number of potential confounders to be even larger than the sample size. By employing sample splitting, cross-fitting and \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-regularized regression estimators of the nuisance functions based on objective functions whose directional derivatives agree with those of the parameter's influence function, we obtain estimators of the target parameter with two desirable robustness properties: (1) they are rate doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when both nuisance functions follow approximately sparse models, even if one function has a very non-sparse regression coefficient, so long as the other has a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient, and (2) they are model doubly-robust in that they are root-n consistent and asymptotically normal even if one of the nuisance functions does not follow an approximately sparse model so long as the other nuisance function follows an approximately sparse model with a sufficiently sparse regression coefficient.},

When the main interest lies in the interaction, this approach is not entirely satisfactory, because it is prone to (possibly severe) bias when the main exposure effects or the associations between outcome and extraneous factors are misspecified. In this article we consider conditional mean models with identity or log link that postulate the statistical interaction in terms of a finite-dimensional parameter but are otherwise unspecified. We show that estimation of the interaction parameter often is not feasible in this model, because it requires nonparametric estimation of auxiliary conditional expectations given high-dimensional variables. We thus consider multiply robust estimation under a union model that assumes that at least one of several working submodels holds. Our approach is novel in that it makes use of information on the joint distribution of the exposures conditional on the extraneous factors in making inferences about the interaction parameter of interest. In the special case of a randomized trial or a family-based genetic study in which the joint exposure distribution is known by design or by Mendelian inheritance, the resulting multiply robust procedure leads to asymptotically distribution-free tests of the null hypothesis of no interaction on an additive scale. We illustrate the methods through simulation and analysis of a randomized follow-up study.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic researchers generalizing or transporting effect estimates from a study to a target population must account for effect-measure modifiers (EMMs) on the scale of interest. However, little attention is paid to how the EMMs required may vary depending on the mathematical nuances of each effect measure. We defined 2 types of EMMs: a marginal EMM, where the effect on the scale of interest differs across levels of a variable, and a conditional EMM, where the effect differs conditional on other variables associated with the outcome. These types define 3 classes of variables: class 1 (conditional EMM), class 2 (marginal but not conditional EMM), and class 3 (neither marginal nor conditional EMM). Class 1 variables are necessary to achieve a valid estimate of the RD in a target population, while an RR requires class 1 and class 2 and an OR requires classes 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., all variables associated with the outcome). This does not mean that fewer variables are required for an externally valid RD (because variables may not modify effects on all scales), but it does suggest that researchers should consider the scale of the effect measure when identifying an EMM necessary for an externally valid treatment effect estimate.},

  abstract = {Here we discuss possible violations of the ``no-multiple-versions-of-treatment'' assumption in studies of outdoor fine particulate air pollution (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 {$\mu$}m (PM2.5)) owing to differences in particle composition, which in turn influence health. This assumption is part of the potential outcomes framework for causal inference, and it is needed for well-defined potential outcomes, as multiple versions of the same treatment could lead to different health risks for the same level of treatment. Since 2 locations can have the same outdoor PM2.5 mass concentration (i.e., treatment) but different chemical compositions (i.e., versions of treatment), violations of the ``no-multiple-versions-of-treatment'' assumption seem likely. Importantly, violations of this assumption will not bias health risk estimates for PM2.5 mass concentrations if there are no unmeasured confounders of the ``version of treatment''\textendash outcome relationship. However, confounding can occur if these factors are not identified and controlled for in the analysis. We describe situations in which this may occur and provide simulations to estimate the magnitude and direction of this possible bias. In general, violations of the ``no-multiple-versions-of-treatment'' assumption could be an underappreciated source of bias in studies of outdoor PM2.5. Analysis of the health impacts of outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations across spatial domains with similar composition could help to address this issue.},

Modified treatment policies generalize static and dynamic interventions, making lmtp and all-purpose package for non-parametric causal inference in observational studies. The methods provided can be applied to both point-treatment and longitudinal settings, and can account for time-varying exposure, covariates, and right censoring thereby providing a very general tool for causal inference. Additionally, two of the provided estimators are based on flexible machine learning regression algorithms, and avoid bias due to parametric model misspecification while maintaining valid statistical inference.},
